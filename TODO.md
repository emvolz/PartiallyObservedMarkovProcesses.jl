## To-do List

- ~~separate simulations into new~~ `SimPompObject` ~~type~~
- implement `pfilter` with new `PfilterdPompObject` type
- ~~separate parameters from~~ `PompObject`
- include explicit typing in `SimPompObject` and `PfilterdPompObject`
- include type checking for `simulate` using data-type included with `PompObject` (??)
- ~~rearrange so~~ `val_array` ~~arrays are sims x params x times~~
- ~~remove most sanity checks from workhorse functions: beef up documentation accordingly~~
- speed tests for simple cases
- `melt` ~~methods will need to be adjusted~~
