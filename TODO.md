## To-do List

- speed trials for `rmca`
- plug-ins for *rprocess*
- It&ocirc;-diffusion example
- iterated filtering
- weighted particle filter
- multiparameter particle filter? should be trivial from existing
- panel pfilter? may be trivial from existing (would need independent resampling)
- `DoubleFloats.Double64` for 128-bit likelihood computations
- documentation
- explore autodiff capabilities
- explore parallelization capabilities
