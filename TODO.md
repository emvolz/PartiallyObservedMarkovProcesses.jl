## To-do List

- iterated filtering
- weighted particle filter
- `DoubleFloats.Double64` for likelihood computations
- `logdmeasure` instead of `dmeasure` with `give_log=true`
- explore autodiff capabilities
- explore parallelization capabilities
- ~~speed tests for simple cases~~
- ~~separate simulations into new~~ `SimPompObject` ~~type~~
- ~~implement~~ `pfilter` ~~with new~~ `PfilterdPompObject` ~~type~~
- ~~separate parameters from~~ `PompObject`
- ~~rearrange so~~ `val_array` ~~arrays are sims x params x times~~
- ~~remove most sanity checks from workhorse functions: beef up documentation accordingly~~
- `melt` ~~methods will need to be adjusted~~
